# Scenario Questions — Streams and Tasks

<article data-difficulty="junior">

## 🟢 Junior: Basic Stream + Task Setup

**Scenario:** New orders are inserted into `raw.orders` every few minutes via Snowpipe. Set up a stream and task to incrementally load new orders into `silver.orders` every 15 minutes (only process new rows, not the full table).

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint</summary>
Create a stream on raw.orders (tracks new inserts). Create a task on a 15-minute schedule with WHEN clause to check if stream has data. INSERT FROM stream with METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT'.
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>

```sql
-- Step 1: Create stream to track changes
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM orders_stream ON TABLE raw.orders;

-- Step 2: Create task to process stream every 15 min
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK load_silver_orders
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_WH'
    SCHEDULE = '15 MINUTE'
    WHEN SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('orders_stream')
AS
    INSERT INTO silver.orders (order_id, customer_id, amount, order_date, _loaded_at)
    SELECT 
        order_id,
        customer_id,
        amount::DECIMAL(10,2),
        order_date::DATE,
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
    FROM orders_stream
    WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT';

-- Step 3: Resume the task (tasks are created suspended!)
ALTER TASK load_silver_orders RESUME;

-- Verify it's running:
SHOW TASKS LIKE 'load_silver_orders';
-- state should be 'started'
```

**Key Points:**
- Stream automatically tracks new rows (zero maintenance)
- `WHEN SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA` prevents empty runs (saves compute)
- After successful INSERT: stream offset advances (won't see these rows again)
- Task must be RESUMED after creation (starts in suspended state)
- If task fails: stream offset stays unchanged → next run retries same data

## 🟢 Junior: Understanding Stream Metadata

**Scenario:** You query `orders_stream` and see rows with `METADATA$ACTION = 'DELETE'` and `METADATA$ISUPDATE = TRUE`. What does this mean? How is an UPDATE represented?

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint</summary>
An UPDATE is represented as a DELETE (old values) + INSERT (new values) pair. Both have METADATA$ISUPDATE = TRUE.
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>

```sql
-- UPDATEs are represented as TWO rows in the stream:

-- Row 1: The OLD values (what was there before)
-- METADATA$ACTION = 'DELETE', METADATA$ISUPDATE = TRUE
-- This is the "before image" of the update

-- Row 2: The NEW values (what it changed to)
-- METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT', METADATA$ISUPDATE = TRUE
-- This is the "after image" of the update

-- Example: customer changed email from old@co.com to new@co.com
-- Stream shows:
-- | customer_id | email | METADATA$ACTION | METADATA$ISUPDATE |
-- | 1001 | old@co.com | DELETE | TRUE | ← old value
-- | 1001 | new@co.com | INSERT | TRUE | ← new value

-- For most ETL: you only want the NEW values:
SELECT * FROM customers_stream
WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT';
-- This gives you: new inserts AND new values of updated rows

-- To find ONLY pure inserts (not updates):
SELECT * FROM customers_stream
WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT' AND METADATA$ISUPDATE = FALSE;

-- To find ONLY updates (before and after):
SELECT * FROM customers_stream
WHERE METADATA$ISUPDATE = TRUE;
```

**Key Points:**
- UPDATE = DELETE (old) + INSERT (new), both with ISUPDATE=TRUE
- INSERT (new row) = ACTION='INSERT', ISUPDATE=FALSE
- DELETE (remove row) = ACTION='DELETE', ISUPDATE=FALSE
- For upsert ETL: filter `WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT'` (gets new + updated)
- For audit trail: keep both DELETE and INSERT rows (full change history)

## 🟡 Mid-Level: MERGE with Full CDC

**Scenario:** Your `customers_stream` captures INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs. Write a MERGE statement that applies all three operations to `silver.customers` (insert new, update existing, delete removed).

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint</summary>
Use a single MERGE with multiple WHEN clauses. Match on customer_id. Handle: INSERT (new row), UPDATE (matched + action=INSERT), DELETE (matched + action=DELETE + isupdate=FALSE).
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>

```sql
MERGE INTO silver.customers t
USING (
    SELECT 
        customer_id, name, email, region,
        METADATA$ACTION AS action,
        METADATA$ISUPDATE AS is_update
    FROM customers_stream
    -- Deduplicate: if same customer appears multiple times, take latest
    QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY _loaded_at DESC) = 1
) s ON t.customer_id = s.customer_id

-- Case 1: Delete (true delete, not part of update)
WHEN MATCHED AND s.action = 'DELETE' AND s.is_update = FALSE 
THEN DELETE

-- Case 2: Update (new version of existing customer)
WHEN MATCHED AND s.action = 'INSERT'
THEN UPDATE SET 
    t.name = s.name,
    t.email = s.email,
    t.region = s.region,
    t.updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()

-- Case 3: Insert (brand new customer)
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND s.action = 'INSERT'
THEN INSERT (customer_id, name, email, region, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (s.customer_id, s.name, s.email, s.region, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
```

**Key Points:**
- One MERGE handles all three CDC operations (elegant, atomic)
- Order of WHEN clauses matters: DELETE check before UPDATE (both are MATCHED)
- `action = 'DELETE' AND is_update = FALSE` = true delete (not part of an UPDATE pair)
- `action = 'INSERT'` for both new rows and updated rows (after image)
- QUALIFY deduplicates in case multiple changes for same customer in one batch
- The entire MERGE is one transaction: stream advances only if ALL operations succeed

## 🟡 Mid-Level: Task DAG Design

**Scenario:** Design a task DAG for: (1) ingest orders (from stream), (2) ingest customers (from stream), (3) join orders+customers into enriched table (depends on both), (4) send notification (depends on join). Show the complete SQL.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint</summary>
Root task has the schedule. Children use AFTER clause. The join task depends on BOTH ingest tasks (fan-in). Notification depends on join task. Resume from leaves to root.
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>

```sql
-- Root task (scheduler — triggers the DAG)
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK pipeline_scheduler
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_WH'
    SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 * * * * UTC'  -- Every hour
    WHEN SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('orders_stream') OR SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('customers_stream')
AS
    SELECT 'pipeline_triggered' AS status;  -- No-op, just starts children

-- Child 1: Ingest orders (runs after scheduler)
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK ingest_orders
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_WH'
    AFTER pipeline_scheduler
AS
    INSERT INTO silver.orders
    SELECT order_id, customer_id, amount, order_date, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
    FROM orders_stream WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT';

-- Child 2: Ingest customers (runs in parallel with orders)
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK ingest_customers
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_WH'
    AFTER pipeline_scheduler
AS
    MERGE INTO silver.customers t
    USING (SELECT * FROM customers_stream WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT') s
    ON t.customer_id = s.customer_id
    WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET t.name = s.name, t.email = s.email
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (s.customer_id, s.name, s.email, s.region);

-- Child 3: Join (depends on BOTH ingest tasks — fan-in)
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK build_enriched_orders
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_WH'
    AFTER ingest_orders, ingest_customers  -- Waits for BOTH to complete!
AS
    INSERT OVERWRITE INTO gold.enriched_orders
    SELECT o.order_id, o.amount, o.order_date, c.name, c.region
    FROM silver.orders o
    JOIN silver.customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 7;

-- Child 4: Notification (depends on join task)
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK send_notification
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_WH'
    AFTER build_enriched_orders
AS
    CALL system$send_email(
        'data-team@company.com',
        'Pipeline Complete',
        'Hourly enriched orders pipeline completed successfully.'
    );

-- RESUME all tasks (order: leaves first, root last)
ALTER TASK send_notification RESUME;
ALTER TASK build_enriched_orders RESUME;
ALTER TASK ingest_customers RESUME;
ALTER TASK ingest_orders RESUME;
ALTER TASK pipeline_scheduler RESUME;

-- DAG execution flow:
-- scheduler → (ingest_orders || ingest_customers) → build_enriched → notify
-- Total: ~5 minutes for the full pipeline
```

**Key Points:**
- Root task has SCHEDULE (only one task per DAG has a schedule)
- Children use `AFTER parent_task` (no schedule, triggered by parent completion)
- Fan-out: multiple children of same parent run in parallel
- Fan-in: `AFTER task_a, task_b` waits for BOTH to complete
- Resume order: leaves first → root last (reverse dependency order)
- If any task fails: downstream tasks don't run (fail-safe)

## 🔴 Senior: Production Pipeline with Error Recovery

**Scenario:** Design a production Streams + Tasks pipeline that: handles errors gracefully (logs, retries), prevents stale streams, monitors SLA compliance (must complete within 30 minutes of data arrival), and supports manual re-processing.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint</summary>
Use stored procedures with TRY/CATCH for error handling. SUSPEND_TASK_AFTER_NUM_FAILURES for auto-suspend. Monitor via TASK_HISTORY. For re-processing: recreate stream (resets offset) + manual task trigger.
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>

```sql
-- STORED PROCEDURE with full error handling
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE etl.process_orders_production()
RETURNS VARCHAR
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
DECLARE
    rows_processed INTEGER;
    start_time TIMESTAMP_NTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();
BEGIN
    -- Check if stream has data (defensive)
    IF (NOT SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('orders_stream')) THEN
        RETURN 'SKIPPED: no data in stream';
    END IF;
    
    -- Process the stream (MERGE into silver)
    MERGE INTO silver.orders t
    USING (
        SELECT order_id, customer_id, amount, order_date,
               METADATA$ACTION, METADATA$ISUPDATE
        FROM orders_stream
        QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY _loaded_at DESC) = 1
    ) s ON t.order_id = s.order_id
    WHEN MATCHED AND s.METADATA$ACTION = 'DELETE' AND NOT s.METADATA$ISUPDATE THEN DELETE
    WHEN MATCHED AND s.METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT' THEN UPDATE SET
        t.amount = s.amount, t.order_date = s.order_date, t.updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
    WHEN NOT MATCHED AND s.METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT' THEN INSERT
        (order_id, customer_id, amount, order_date, created_at, updated_at)
        VALUES (s.order_id, s.customer_id, s.amount, s.order_date, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
    
    rows_processed := SQLROWCOUNT;
    
    -- Log success
    INSERT INTO etl.pipeline_log (pipeline_name, status, rows_processed, duration_sec, run_time)
    VALUES ('process_orders', 'SUCCESS', rows_processed,
            TIMESTAMPDIFF('second', start_time, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
    
    RETURN 'SUCCESS: ' || rows_processed || ' rows in ' || 
           TIMESTAMPDIFF('second', start_time, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) || 's';

EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHER THEN
        -- Log failure (this INSERT runs even though main transaction rolls back)
        INSERT INTO etl.pipeline_log (pipeline_name, status, error_message, run_time)
        VALUES ('process_orders', 'FAILED', SQLERRM, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
        
        RAISE;  -- Re-raise to mark task as FAILED
END;
$$;

-- TASK with production settings
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK orders_production_task
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_WH'
    SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON */15 * * * * UTC'
    SUSPEND_TASK_AFTER_NUM_FAILURES = 3  -- Auto-suspend after 3 failures
    WHEN SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('orders_stream')
AS
    CALL etl.process_orders_production();

-- SLA MONITORING (separate alert task)
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK sla_monitor
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_WH'
    SCHEDULE = '5 MINUTE'
AS
BEGIN
    -- Check: is data older than 30 min without being processed?
    LET stale_minutes := (
        SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF('minute', MAX(_loaded_at), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
        FROM raw.orders
        WHERE _loaded_at > DATEADD('hour', -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
    );
    
    LET last_silver_update := (
        SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF('minute', MAX(updated_at), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
        FROM silver.orders
    );
    
    IF (last_silver_update > 30) THEN
        CALL system$send_email(
            'data-team@company.com',
            'SLA BREACH: Orders pipeline',
            'Silver orders table has not been updated in ' || last_silver_update || ' minutes.'
        );
    END IF;
END;

-- MANUAL RE-PROCESSING (when needed):
-- If stream became stale or you need to reprocess:
-- 1. Suspend task
ALTER TASK orders_production_task SUSPEND;
-- 2. Recreate stream (resets offset to current state)
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM orders_stream ON TABLE raw.orders;
-- 3. Do a full load (one-time catch-up)
INSERT INTO silver.orders SELECT * FROM raw.orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
-- 4. Resume task (stream now tracks from this point forward)
ALTER TASK orders_production_task RESUME;
```

**Key Points:**
- Stored procedure: TRY/CATCH logs errors, RAISE re-throws to mark task as failed
- SUSPEND_TASK_AFTER_NUM_FAILURES: auto-suspends to prevent infinite error loops
- Pipeline log: tracks success/failure, rows processed, duration (for SLA monitoring)
- SLA monitoring: separate task checking freshness every 5 minutes
- Manual re-processing: suspend → recreate stream → full load → resume
- Stream transactions: failed MERGE rolls back → stream unchanged → next run retries
